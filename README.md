search-prediction-based-on-user-input
=====================================

Drops down a list of suggestions for a search term. The suggestions are generated based on the user's input string. Using JQuery, an AJAX call is made to a server side script in PHP. This PHP script queries the database and returns a list of records that matches the given term. These records are then beautifully appended to the UI without any page navigation.
